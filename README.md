# Interactive webapp for exploring techno-economic landscapes of abatement options for hard-to-electrify sectors.
## Overview
This interactive webapp is offered as a complement to [the research software](https://github.com/clarabachorz/mapping-hte-sectors) used to obtain results for the article **Exploring techno-economic landscapes of abatement options for hard-to-electrify sectors** (link and DOI TBC). It can be used to visualize the details of the levelized cost components interactively.

## Running the webapp
